The files in this directory are data for some of the plots and
demonstrations in the textbook.

The files come in three categories:

I) Wavelet and scaling function files
II) Blind source separation demonstration files
III) Test image for emission tomography example

I) Wavelet and scaling function files

The ascii files

d41
d42
d61
d62
d81
d82
d101
d102
d121
d122

contain scaling functions (file names ending in 1) and wavelet
functions (file names ending in 2).  The time parameter and the
function value are represented in these two-column files.

II) Blind source separation demonstration files

They files to demonstrate blind source separation were recorded using
the xwave tool (v.0.6) on a linux workstation at 8000 samples/second,
8 bits/sample, using a low-quality (office-style) microphone.

tkm.wav is the voice of Todd Moon, reading about blind source separation.  

ag.wav is the voice of Amy Griffin, reading some nameless memo.

vm.wav is from the track "Voice Male," of the all-vocal group, Voice
   Male, off their album "up, up and away,"  copyright 1997 Voice
   Male.  Used by permission.

Recording of the first two sources was accomplished by speaking
directly into the microphone.  Recording of the third source was
accomplished by playing the CD into the microphone.  In all cases, the
artifacts due to the recording process (hiss, pop, and quantization
noise) can be heard by playing the original unmixed files.  (You
should really here Voice Male off the original CD to appreciate it!)
It may be observed thus that the artifacts heard in the final
separated output files are due mostly to recording artifacts, and not
the separation process.

.wav files:
Original (unmixed) files:
vm.wav
ag.wav
tkm.wav

Mixed files (input data):
bssin1.wav
bssin2.wav
bssin3.wav

Separated (output) files:
bssout1.wav
bssout2.wav
bssout3.wav

III) Test image for emission tomography example

im1.mat is a simple test image used for the emission tomography
example.
